# rpos
Raspberry Pi Onvif Server

Node.js based Onvif Soap service. (http://www.onvif.org) 

Initial goal is to provide a Onvif Media service which is compatible with Synology Surveillance Station.
This allows the Pi to be used as a surveillance camera without the need for adding any custom camera files to your Synology NAS.

This version uses a patched version of the "node-soap" v0.80 library (https://github.com/vpulim/node-soap/releases/tag/v0.8.0) located @ https://github.com/BreeeZe/node-soap

#Features:

- Streams H264 video over rtsp
- Camera control (resolution and framerate) through Onvif

#How to:

Install the live555 library to stream h264 video over rtsp [ source http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=69224&start=15#p289293 ] :

	*login to your pi via ssh
	cd /home/pi/
	wget http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/public/live555-latest.tar.gz
	tar xvzf live555-latest.tar.gz
	cd live
	./genMakefiles linux
	make

Install nodejs on your pi (http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/):

	wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb
	sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb

Download rpos master from github to your pi
	
	wget https://github.com/BreeeZe/rpos/archive/master.zip
	unzip master.zip
	cd rpos-master
	npm install
	sudo chmod -R a+rwx ./bin/rtspServer
	
Be sure to configure the ipaddress, service port, rtsp stream name and rtsp port in "config.js" ("nano config.js")

Then you start rpos by running "sudo node server.js" (or "sudo nodejs server.js" depending on your installed nodejs version.)

#Known Issues
- 1920x1080 can cause hangs and crashes.

#ToDo's
- Add authentication
- Add MJPEG
- Implement more ONVIF calls
- and more...
