# rpos
Raspberry Pi Onvif Service

Node.js Onvif (http://www.onvif.org) based Soap service.

Initial goal is to provide a Onvif Media service which is compatible with Synology Surveillance Station.
This allows the Pi to be used as a surveillance camera without the need for adding any custom camera files to your Synology NAS.

This version uses a patched version of the "node-soap" v0.80 library (https://github.com/vpulim/node-soap/releases/tag/v0.8.0) located @ https://github.com/BreeeZe/node-soap

#How to:

Download the code on your machine (which has nodejs installed) and restore the dependencies using the "npm update" command.

Copy the code to your Pi

to stream h264 video [ source http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=69224&start=15#p289293 ] :

	*login to your pi via ssh
	cd /home/pi/
	wget http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/public/live555-latest.tar.gz
	tar xvzf live555-latest.tar.gz
	cd live
	./genMakefiles linux
	make

	wget http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/download/file.php?id=4285
	tar xvzf testRaspi.tar.gz
	cd raspi

	*To increase OutPacketBuffer::maxSize which is require for large resolutions, modify testRaspi.cpp and add
		OutPacketBuffer::maxSize = 1024000;
	*before the following line in testRaspi.cpp
		// Create the RTSP server:
		RTSPServer* rtspServer = RTSPServer::createNew(*env, 8554, authDB);
	*then run
	make

	*start the stream by running :
	raspivid -o - -fps 25 -t 0 -b 10000000 -g 2 -ih -drc high -ex auto -w 1920 -h 1080  | ~/live/raspi/testRaspi

install nodejs on your pi (http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/)
	wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb
	sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb
	
configure the ipaddress, service port, rtsp stream name and rtsp port in "config.js"

start rpos by running "sudo node server.js" (or "sudo nodejs server.js" depending on your installed nodejs version.)


#ToDo's
- Start stream from rpos
- Configure stream from rpos
- Add authentication
- Add snapshots
- Add MJPEG
- Implement more ONVIF calls
- and more...
