Raspberry Pi Onvif Service

Node.js based Onvif (http://www.onvif.org) based Soap service.

Initial goal is to provide a Onvif Media service which is compatible with Synology Surveillance Station.
This allows the Pi to be used as a surveillance camera without the need for adding any custom camera files to your Synology NAS.
