# rpos
Raspberry Pi Onvif Server

Node.js based Onvif Soap service. (http://www.onvif.org) 

Initial goal is to provide a Onvif Media service which is compatible with Synology Surveillance Station.
This allows the Pi to be used as a surveillance camera without the need for adding any custom camera files to your Synology NAS.

This version uses a patched version of the "node-soap" v0.80 library (https://github.com/vpulim/node-soap/releases/tag/v0.8.0) located @ https://github.com/BreeeZe/node-soap

#How to:

Download the code on your machine (one which has nodejs installed) and restore the dependencies using the "npm update" command or if you have Visual Studio 2013 and Nodejs tools, open the solution and build it. (https://nodejstools.codeplex.com)

Copy the code to your Pi.

Install the live555 library to stream h264 video over rtsp [ source http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?f=82&t=69224&start=15#p289293 ] :

	*login to your pi via ssh
	cd /home/pi/
	wget http://www.live555.com/liveMedia/public/live555-latest.tar.gz
	tar xvzf live555-latest.tar.gz
	cd live
	./genMakefiles linux
	make

Install GStreamer 1.0 (needed for snapshots) :

	sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0

And to install nodejs on your pi (http://weworkweplay.com/play/raspberry-pi-nodejs/):

	wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb
	sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb

Be sure to configure the ipaddress, service port, rtsp stream name and rtsp port in "config.js"

Then you start rpos by running "sudo node server.js" (or "sudo nodejs server.js" depending on your installed nodejs version.)


#ToDo's
- Configure stream from rpos
- Add authentication
- Add MJPEG
- Implement more ONVIF calls
- and more...
